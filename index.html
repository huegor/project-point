              most medical professionals are not even aware that such an issue exists.

            <h3>Introducing: Laminar Flow Technology.</h3>
            <p>
              Laminar flow is tidy, predictable, and beautiful &mdash; it occurs when all particles of a fluid are moving parallel to each other.
              Laminar flow looks like a beam of crystal frozen in mid-air, landing with nary a spatter into the open bowl of the toilet. However,
              producing a laminar flow requires extremely specific conditions to be met, which are nearly impossible to satistfy with our natural-born
              bodies; luckily, we don't have to settle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our interdiciplinary research and development team is utilizing microfluidics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and other cutting-edge
              microtechnologies to create the safest, most functional, and most affordable micturation device. Right now, we are building our Mark
              I prototype, which is on track to be unveiled as soon as 2022.
