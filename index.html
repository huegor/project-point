        <h2>Project Point is a radical grassroots movement paving the way for unscrupulous urinators to get the medical care they
          need &mdash; genitalia augmentation for the perfect laminar flow pee stream. </h2>
        <p>Through research and development, public fundraising, and community advocacy, we combat stigma and empower individuals with
          life-saving resources for a safer and cleaner future.</p>

        <h2>The future is now or never.</h2>
        <p>Every day, billions are plagued by the pain of living with an unpredictable splintering stream. Clean ups are at best tedious,
          and at worst downright dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the mental burden resulting from not being able to pee accurately greatly increases
          one's chances of developing mental illness or committing suicide: 41% reported attempting suicide at some point in their lives,
          which is almost nine times higher than that of the general population. This gulf is further exacerbated by the fact
          that wayward aimers face discrimiation at every turn, from employment, to housing, to social acceptance among family and peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the greatest tragedy of all is that although our current medical infrastructures have both the ways and the means to change the
          lives of these vulnerable individuals, no action has been taken by the medical community at all to acknowledge this problem. In fact,
          most medical professionals are not even aware that such an issue exists.

        <h2>We're here to lift the lid and fill in the gaps.</h2>
        <p>
          As messy micturators ourselves, Project Point is developing the first-ever medical pathway &mdash; by and for the community &mdash;
          to address this glaring need. Such a deeply entrenched inequity can only be alleviated through a holistic approach that addresses
          all parts of the problem:
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, we seek out and engage with individuals like ourselves in order to unite and uplift each other. Project Point creates and hosts
          both physical and digital spaces for our community members to interact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we raise awareness and generate conversations around this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we need a physical device that will augment an individual's existing faculties to create an aimable pee stream.
          Partnering with scientists, engineers, and designers from all over the world,
          we are building a device that will allow any individual, regardless of size, shape, or capacity, to unrinate the perfect laminar flow.
        </p>

        <h2>Introducing: Laminar Flow Technology.</h2>
        <p>
          Laminar flow is tidy, predictable, and beautiful &mdash; it occurs when all particles of a fluid are moving parallel to each other.
          Laminar flow looks like a beam of crystal frozen in mid-air, landing with nary a spatter into the open bowl of the toilet. However,
          producing a laminar flow requires extremely specific conditions to be met, which are nearly impossible to satistfy with our natural-born
          bodies; luckily, we don't have to settle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our interdiciplinary research and development team is utilizing microfluidics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and other cutting-edge
          microtechnologies to create the safest, most functional, and most affordable micturation device. Right now, we are building our Mark
          I prototype, which is on track to be unveiled as soon as 2022.
